# Explanation of Output Tables

This document provides a detailed explanation of the tables generated by DeepSAS. Each table contains valuable insights into senescent cells (SnCs) and senescence-associated genes (SnGs) across different cell types.

## Table 1: Cell_Table1_SnC_scores.csv

This table contains information about each cell in the dataset and its senescence score.

**Columns:**
- **cell_id**: Unique identifier for each cell.
- **cell_name**: The name or label assigned to the cell.
- **cell_type**: The assigned cluster/type of the cell.
- **ifSnCs**: Binary indicator (1 = Senescent Cell, 0 = Non-Senescent Cell).
- **SnC scores**: The senescence score calculated for each cell.

## Table 2: Gene_Table2_DEG_ct_SnG_score.csv

This table summarizes differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between senescent cells (SnCs) and non-senescent cells (non-SnCs) within each cell type. It also includes senescence-associated gene scores.

**Column Explanations:**
- **gene**: The name of the gene being analyzed.
- **cell_type**: The cell type in which this gene was found to be differentially expressed.
- **p_val**: The raw p-value from the differential gene expression test.
  This value is obtained from a Wilcoxon rank-sum test that compares gene expression levels between senescent cells (SnCs) and non-senescent cells (non-SnCs) within the same cell type.
- **logFC**: Log fold-change (log2-transformed).
  A positive value means the gene is upregulated in SnCs compared to non-SnCs, while a negative value means it is downregulated.
- **p_val_adj**: The adjusted p-value (multiple testing correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method).
  This accounts for false discoveries when testing multiple genes.
  Typically, genes with p_val_adj < 0.05 are considered significant.
- **SnG_score**: The senescence-associated gene (SnG) score for this gene within the given cell type.
  This score is derived from attention-weighted gene-cell interactions, reflecting how strongly the gene contributes to senescence in this specific cell type.
  There is no strict cutoff, but higher scores indicate stronger senescence association.
- **hallmarker**: Indicates whether the gene is a known senescence hallmark gene.
  True means the gene is part of a predefined list of senescence-related genes.
  False means the gene is newly identified in this analysis.

## Table 3: Gene_newTable3_gene_ct_count.csv

`Gene_Table3_gene_ct_count.csv`:

This table summarizes the genes from Table 2, grouping them by the number of cell types in which they appear as differentially expressed.

`Gene_newTable3_gene_ct_count.csv`: filter rows where "cell_type" column contains only one cell type.

**Differences between Table 2 and Table 3:**
- Table 2 provides detailed information on each gene in each cell type.
- Table 3 aggregates this information by gene, summarizing in how many cell types the gene is differentially expressed.

**Column Explanations:**
- **gene**: The gene name.
- **cell_type**: A list of cell types where the gene was differentially expressed.
- **p_val**: Mean p-value across all cell types.
- **logFC**: Mean log fold-change across all cell types.
- **p_val_adj**: Mean adjusted p-value across all cell types.
- **SnG_score**: Mean senescence-associated gene score across all cell types.
- **hallmarker**: Whether the gene is a known senescence hallmark gene.

## Additional Tables

### Cell_Table2_SnCs_per_ct.csv

### Table 2 Split by Gene and Cell Type
